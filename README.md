# Webscraping-101
Learning how to scrape websites.

Motivation
While taking the Full Stack Nano degree course offered by Udacity, I wanted to work on other webapps and needed data to populate my databases.
I could have used other online services for this data buy I find working with real life data may be more helpful.
Plus its always good to learn something new.

Goal
Use the data to create RESTful api's.
